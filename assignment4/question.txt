Data Structures & Algorithms with Python Module 4 Homework:


You have a total of 6 exercises. 3 from Queues and 3 from Stacks :)


QUEUE:

1. Reverse the first 3 elements of a queue

TODO: Reverse only the first 3 items in the queue. Keep the rest in the same order.

Example:
Input queue: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output queue: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Tips:

Queues remove from the front (index 0).

A stack is useful for reversing order.

Steps idea: take 3 items off the queue -> then push to a stack -> pop from stack back to the front.



2. Rolling queue (keep only last 5 numbers)

TODO: Ask the user for numbers until they enter an empty string. Store them in a queue, but keep only the last 5 numbers entered.

Example:
User enters: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Queue at the end should contain: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Tips:

Use input() in a loop.

When the queue grows beyond length 5, remove from the front.

Convert input to int after checking it’s not empty.



3. Round-robin time processing

TODO: You have a queue of tasks. Each task is a tuple (name, time_needed).

Each round:
Take the front task.
Give it 2 time units of work.
If it still needs time, put it back to the end with updated remaining time.
If it finishes, remove it and record its name.

Return/print: the order in which tasks finish.

Example:
Tasks: [("A", 3), ("B", 6), ("C", 1)]
Completion order (one possible expected result): ["A", "C", "B"]

Tips:

Use a while queue: loop.

Subtract 2 each time you process a task.

If remaining time is > 0, re-enqueue it.

Otherwise, append its name to a finished list.




STACK: 


1. Find the minimum value in a stack

TODO: Given a stack of numbers (a Python list), print the smallest number in it.

Example:
Stack: [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]
Output: 1

Tips:

Python has a built-in function that finds the smallest number in a list.

Make sure the stack is not empty before trying to find a minimum.



2. Undo last N actions

TODO: You have a stack of actions (strings). Undo the last n actions safely:

Pop up to n items from the stack.

If n is larger than the stack size, just undo what exists.

Example:
Actions: ["open", "edit", "save", "close"], n = 2
Undone: ["close", "save"]
Left in stack: ["open", "edit"]

Tips:

Use a for loop that runs n times.

Before popping, check if the stack is empty.

Store undone actions in a separate list.



3. Simplify a file path using a stack

TODO: Simplify a Unix-like path:

"." means "stay here" -> ignore it

".." means "go back one folder" -> pop from stack if possible

Folder names push onto the stack
Ignore extra slashes

Example:
Input: "/home//user/.././docs"
Output: "/home/docs"

Tips:

Split the path by "/" to get parts.

Skip empty parts and ".".

On "..", pop if the stack isn’t empty.

At the end, join the stack back into a path starting with "/".
